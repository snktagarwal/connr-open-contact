1. Write a thrift file
connr_comm.thrift
Generate python code

2. Write a server architecture:
connr_server.py
This should recive POSTdata with a thrift encoded string
This should de-serialize the string and call a function say, handle_postdata()

3. Write a simple client:
The client will create a stub thrift object and make a call to the server
generate_object()
send_to_server()

4. Bootstrap the client by replacing/swap send_to_server() with a function to call handle_postdata()

5. Make sure that both behaviours are identical.

6. DOCUMENT
